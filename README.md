About my own project. This is a project I was able to apply many functions after my internship and self-study:

# Technology used:

+ Frontend:
- React.js
- HTML/CSS/JS
- styled-component,
- redux, redux-toolkits
- mui5, timeagojs, ....

+ Backend:
- Node.js, Express.js
- MongoDB, Firebase
- mongoose, axios, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, cookie-parser, dotenv, cors, ....

+ Main fuction:
+ Functions without login:
- Watch all videos by categories: new, trending, all videos of the channels you have subscribed to.
- Search for videos by the title in English and Vietnamese.
- Paginated by categories: new, trending, subscribed users with only one component (not using any libraries).
- The views of each video increase every time you watch it.

+ User functions need to login and authenticate:
- Login/logout/register by normal way and by google (I didn't do too much with this part, just check if the username and password were correct or wrong, because I didn't want to waste time).
- Upload your personal videos.
- Add, edit and delete your own comments.
- If you are the video owner (channel owner), you can delete other people's comments if you don't like it.
- Follow/unfollow other users but not yourself.
- Like and dislike videos.

+) Other features:
- Light / Dark theme with color and background color
- Read more / read less depends on the character length of the description of each video
- Video recommendations depend on the tags of each video
- Authenticate user rights with each private action with jwt

For now, I am having an error with uploading the client folder, I'm checking on it and will upload it as soon as possible.

I also intend to update other functions in the future for personal purposes.

Thank you.
